# Lab 7 
### By Curtis J. Bradley, Juan Malpartida Rodriguez, & Kevin Lu
This Lab recreates an INN reservation manager. 

# How To Run
This project is written in Python 3, and it requires the user to build 
the app using the main.py file. For the application to run properly, it needs all FR sql files
to be in the working directory (there should be 4 of them). 
Also, it requires the user to install any missing dependencies.
## possible commands needed to resolve dependencies
* pip3 install mysql.connector
* pip3 install pandas
